or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

[Does this Link?](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-emilee197/blob/main/weekly-reports/2023_08_28_week.md#report-1---week-of-08212023)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting!
