We started off the semester running with our first project that primarily uses Rhino and Grasshopper. This was not only my first time using Rhino/Grasshopper but my first time ever using a 3D modeling software! Watching the demos was quite intimidating as everything from the basic interface to the complex code base seemed incomprehensible. I started off by watching Kyle's videos, which were incredibly detailed but because of my novelty to this domain, remained still too advanced. After struggling through the three videos, I scaled back my ego to start from the beginning...like the very basics. The Rhino introduction videos on how to even pan, zoom, and switch orientations was much more digestable and gave me hope that I could begin to tackle this software. 

I scheduled to print my phone stand on Monday morning so I had to have my file ready by Sunday night. Because of the time rush, I wasn't able to figure out how to change parameters in time through Rhino yet, so I ended up just making different customizations such as rounding of pieces and a "Mdes '24" raster. You can see them in the final photos below! I'm glad I did a test cut first with a little square because it didn't cut out at first, but after decreasing the speed to increase the power, the final pieces cut out perfectly!

Our class on Monday 8/28 was really helpful in understanding how to navigate some of the Rhino and Grasshopper files together. I was finally able to set my own parameters in Grasshopper and see them reflected in Rhino!

I have an iphone 13 mini, which has dimensions of 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.7 mm. I tried adjusting the parameters in grasshopper to reflect my own phone, but the first time I tried this, the programs crashed my laptop. The second time however, it worked, which is seen in the picture below in the lower right context box:
